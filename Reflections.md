# Reflections

Decided to utilize docker and docker compose to orchestrate the deployment of the application. I enjoyed learning how to properly utilize and implement the Vue framework inside this app, and how to take the tailwindcss stylizing and apply that to this given app. It's a hair different than applying it via a python webapp, though even in a python webapp it still requires nodejs. So, utilizing it in its native environment was a fun exercise. 

I hated troubleshooting this entire application though. Quite a few many errors were thrown at me, and google was generally a solid guidance. 

I have no excuse for being late but im blaming cats or something. :)
