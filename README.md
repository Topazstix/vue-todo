# Homework 8

**Late, but better than never.**
This assignment was to create a javascript todo application utilizing our framework of choice. I've decided to utilize the Vue.js framework in tandem with tailwindcss for styling. Both frameworks are ones I plan to utilize in future projects and programs, so gaining a better understanding of these is something I find interest in.

## Start the App

- `docker-compose up`

## Table of Contents
